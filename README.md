# Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers

# Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

# Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

# Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory. 

• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.

• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights. 

• Pest/disease detection via image uploads. 

• Market price tracking.

• Voice support for low-literate users. 

• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

# Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers 

• Agricultural extension officers

• Government agriculture departments 

• NGOs and cooperatives 

• Agri-tech startups

# Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022). 

• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

# Problem Creater's Organization:

Government of Punjab

# Theme:

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

# Proposed Solution:

# Community Knowledge Sharing:
A platform for farmers to interact, share experiences, and learn from one another with expert moderation.

# Pest and Disease Detection:
Mobile-based image recognition (AI/ML) to detect crop diseases/pests and provide immediate treatment suggestions.

# Resource Optimization:
Advises farmers on the optimal use of fertilizers, pesticides, and water to improve yield and reduce costs.
A knowledge-driven advisory system that provides:

# Soil testing-based crop selection.

• Step-by-step crop lifecycle guidance (sowing, irrigation, fertilizer, harvest).

• Easy-to-understand, localized language support (mobile app/SMS).

# Technical Approach:
• Creating apps to help farmers communicate with government.

• Apps to buy good quality manures and required things.  

• AI based apps to provide accurate weather conditions.

# Feasibility and Viability:

A Smart Crop Advisory System is feasible due to available mobile/cloud infrastructure, public datasets, and AI, but faces risks from language barriers, connectivity issues, and low digital literacy.

# Impact and Benefits:

Small and marginal farmers lack access to personalized agricultural guidance, leading to inefficient practices, crop failures, and reduced income, while smart crop advisory systems address this by providing data-driven, region-specific recommendations on irrigation, pest control, and optimal crops via affordable, user-friendly technology, boosting yields, reducing costs, improving resilience to climate shocks, and enhancing overall food security and farmer livelihoods.Efficient use of resources (water, fertilizer, pesticides) lowers environmental pollution, soil degradation.Promotes sustainable practices, possibly more resilient crop varieties.

# Research and References:
Title:
Smart Agriculture System Using IoT and AI/ML: A Survey (IJERT 2024)

Location: India	

Key attributes:
Survey of existing systems; summarises what technologies (sensors, ML, IoT, remote sensing) are used, what gaps exist

Strength & Weakness:
Useful for mapping the space; gap: many surveyed systems are prototypes, lacking long-term field outcomes.
